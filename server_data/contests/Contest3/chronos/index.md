## Task

Zero has lost all sense of time and is desperately trying to figure out if he's in a time loop.

A time loop is guaranteed if the string he reads is the same when reversed.

Since he's too dizzy, he wants you to tell him if the given string is a palindrome.

### Input Format

The input will consist of a single line containing a string $S$ representing the command.

### Output Format

Print "YES" if the string is a palindrome, otherwise print "NO".

### Constraints

*   $1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$, where $|S|$ is the length of the string $S$.
*   $S$ will only consist of lowercase or uppercase latin letters.
