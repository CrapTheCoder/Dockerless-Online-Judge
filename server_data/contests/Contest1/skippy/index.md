## Task

Valerie figured out the command to put Skippy the gun into the "Stone Cold Killer" mode. The problem is that Skippy does the reverse of whatever you ask him!

Since Valerie is busy hanging out with Judy, you need to help her by reversing the command.

### Input Format

The input will consist of a single line containing a string $S$ representing the command.

### Output Format

Print a single string, the reversed command.

### Constraints

*   $1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$, where $|S|$ is the length of the string $S$.
*   $S$ will only consist of lowercase latin letters.
